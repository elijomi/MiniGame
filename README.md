# Mini Game

A small collection of simple browser games — and a playground for me to experiment with Codex-driven development.

## Overview
Mini Game is me experimenting with Codex: trying ideas quickly, iterating on UI and game logic, and keeping things lightweight. The project currently focuses on bite‑sized games you can run in the browser.

## What’s Inside
- Memory: a classic card‑matching game
- Whack‑A‑Mole: tap targets before they disappear
- Snake: grow the snake while dodging walls and yourself
- Solitaire: a simple single‑player card game

## Goals
- Keep the code approachable and easy to tinker with
- Use Codex to explore refactors and small features
- Favor clarity over cleverness

## Development Notes
This repo uses Razor components (Blazor) for pages and UI. Game pages live under `BrowserFun/Pages/` and static assets under `BrowserFun/wwwroot/`.

## Status
Actively evolving. Expect rough edges and frequent small tweaks as I try things with Codex.
